# NewYork Neighbourhood Prices Dashboard

### Project Description
The project aims at creating a complete informative & interactive dashboard using Tableau showing information about New York Neighbourhood Prices. This was a personnal project to apply the concepts I learned from DataCamp courses.

### About the Data
The dataset used for this project was about "NewYork Neighbourhood Prices". It consists of 17615 rows and 12 columns in a Xlsx file.

### Project Process
To begin the project, the Excel file was imported to the Tableau environment and some transformations to the data were performed. 
Then, the following steps were taken:
- Measuring the price ranges of room types per neighbourhood.
- The average reviews for each room type.
- The minimum nights for every room type.
- The days occupied in 2019 for each city.
